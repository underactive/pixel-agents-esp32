## Audit Subagents

After finishing implementation of a plan, run the following subagents **in parallel** to audit all changed files.

> **Scope directive for all subagents:** Only flag issues in the changed code and its immediate dependents. Do not audit the entire codebase.

> **Output directive:** After all subagents complete, write a single consolidated audit report to `docs/exec-plans/completed/{epoch}-{plan_name}/audit.md`, using the same directory as the corresponding `plan.md`. The audit report **must** include a **Files changed** section listing all files where findings were flagged. This section is **required** -- it serves as a lightweight index for future planning, covering files affected by audit findings (including immediate dependents not in the original implementation).

### 1. QA Audit (subagent)
Review changes for:
- **Functional correctness**: broken workflows, missing error/loading states, unreachable code paths, logic that doesn't match spec
- **Edge cases**: empty/null/undefined inputs, zero-length collections, off-by-one errors, race conditions, boundary values (min/max/overflow)
- **Infinite loops**: unbounded `while`/recursive calls, callbacks triggering themselves, retry logic without max attempts or backoff
- **Performance**: unnecessary computation in hot paths, O(n^2) or worse in loops over growing data, unthrottled event handlers, expensive operations blocking main thread or interrupt context

### 2. Security Audit (subagent)
Review changes for:
- **Injection / input trust**: unsanitized external input used in commands, queries, or output rendering; format string vulnerabilities; untrusted data used in control flow
- **Overflows**: unbounded buffer writes, unguarded index access, integer overflow/underflow in arithmetic, unchecked size parameters
- **Memory leaks**: allocated resources not freed on all exit paths, event/interrupt handlers not deregistered on cleanup, growing caches or buffers without eviction or bounds
- **Hard crashes**: null/undefined dereferences without guards, unhandled exceptions in async or interrupt context, uncaught error propagation across module boundaries

### 3. Interface Contract Audit (subagent)
Review changes for:
- **Data shape mismatches**: caller assumptions that diverge from actual API/protocol schema, missing fields treated as present, incorrect type coercion or endianness
- **Error handling**: no distinction between recoverable and fatal errors, swallowed failures, missing retry/backoff on transient faults, no timeout or watchdog configuration
- **Auth / privilege flows**: credential or token lifecycle issues, missing permission checks, race conditions during handshake or session refresh
- **Data consistency**: optimistic state updates without rollback on failure, stale cache served after mutation, sequence counters or cursors not invalidated after writes

### 4. State Management Audit (subagent)
Review changes for:
- **Mutation discipline**: shared state modified outside designated update paths, state transitions that skip validation, side effects hidden inside getters or read operations
- **Reactivity / observation pitfalls**: mutable updates that bypass change detection or notification mechanisms, deeply nested state triggering unnecessary cascading updates
- **Data flow**: excessive pass-through of context across layers where a shared store or service belongs, sibling modules communicating via parent state mutation, event/signal spaghetti without cleanup
- **Sync issues**: local copies shadowing canonical state, multiple sources of truth for the same entity, concurrent writers without arbitration (locks, atomics, or message ordering)

### 5. Resource & Concurrency Audit (subagent)
Review changes for:
- **Concurrency**: data races on shared memory, missing locks/mutexes/atomics around critical sections, deadlock potential from lock ordering, priority inversion in RTOS or threaded contexts
- **Resource lifecycle**: file handles, sockets, DMA channels, or peripherals not released on error paths; double-free or use-after-free; resource exhaustion under sustained load
- **Timing**: assumptions about execution order without synchronization, spin-waits without yield or timeout, interrupt latency not accounted for in real-time constraints
- **Power & hardware**: peripherals left in active state after use, missing clock gating or sleep transitions, watchdog not fed on long operations, register access without volatile or memory barriers

### 6. Testing Coverage Audit (subagent)
Review changes for:
- **Missing tests**: new public functions/modules without corresponding unit tests, modified branching logic without updated assertions, deleted tests not replaced
- **Test quality**: assertions on implementation details instead of behavior, tests coupled to internal structure, mocked so heavily the test proves nothing
- **Integration gaps**: cross-module flows tested only with mocks and never with integration or contract tests, initialization/shutdown sequences untested, error injection paths uncovered
- **Flakiness risks**: tests dependent on timing or sleep, shared mutable state between test cases, non-deterministic data (random IDs, timestamps), hardware-dependent tests without abstraction layer

### 7. DX & Maintainability Audit (subagent)
Review changes for:
- **Readability**: functions exceeding ~50 lines, boolean parameters without named constants, magic numbers/strings without explanation, nested ternaries or conditionals deeper than one level
- **Dead code**: unused includes/imports, unreachable branches behind stale feature flags, commented-out blocks with no context, exported symbols with zero consumers
- **Naming & structure**: inconsistent naming conventions, business/domain logic buried in UI or driver layers, utility functions duplicated across modules
- **Documentation**: public API changes without updated doc comments, non-obvious workarounds missing a `// WHY:` comment, breaking changes without migration notes

## Audit Post-Implementation

After audit findings have been addressed, update the `implementation.md` file in the corresponding `docs/exec-plans/completed/{epoch}-{plan_name}/` directory:

1. **Flag fixed items** -- In the audit report (`docs/exec-plans/completed/{epoch}-{plan_name}/audit.md`), mark each finding that was fixed with a `[FIXED]` prefix so it is visually distinct from unresolved items.

2. **Append a fixes summary** -- Add an `## Audit Fixes` section at the end of `implementation.md` containing:
   - **Fixes applied** -- a numbered list of each fix, referencing the audit finding it addresses (e.g., "Fixed unchecked index access flagged by Security Audit S2")
   - **Verification checklist** -- a `- [ ]` checkbox list of specific tests or manual checks to confirm each fix is correct (e.g., "Verify bounds check on `configIndex` with out-of-range input returns fallback")

3. **Leave unresolved items as-is** -- Any audit findings intentionally deferred or accepted as-is should remain unmarked in the audit report. Add a brief note in the fixes summary explaining why they were not addressed.

4. **Update testing checklist** -- If any audit fixes changed user-facing behavior, add corresponding `- [ ]` test items to `docs/references/testing-checklist.md`. Each item should describe the expected observable behavior, not the implementation detail.
